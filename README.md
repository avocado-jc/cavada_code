# cavada_code
Personal repository for code

This is where you can find some of my projects since embarking on the path towards becoming a web developer March 2022 - Aug 2022. I started a full-stack bootcamp with PDX Code Guild late April after some very basic self-study (mainly command-line basics), but also the Guild's two week Python crash course.

You will see some python apps, as well as Flask, and Django projects, and JavaScript pretty soon (sometime during or after July 2022). Thank you for your attention, and please direct any questions or concerns to myself at cavada.jonathon@gmail.com
